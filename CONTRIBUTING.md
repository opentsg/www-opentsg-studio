# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project and to the
website. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License

this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as

need a **CLA** and check back here to see when we're accepting inputs.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one

again.
